# PyBer_Analysis
Analysis using matplotlib

## Overview
This is an analysis for a ridesharing app company. In this project, we are creating visualizations for ridesharing data for the company using matplotlib, a python graphing library. In this project we are using different charts depending on what we would like to visualize such as line charts, pie charts, scatter, and bar charts. Each one of them is good to represent a dataset depending on the nature of data. For example, if we would like to compare different groups hights, it is better to use a bar chart as that will be more accurate and distinct.

## Results

We first visualized number of fares per month using different charts. We noticed that in July the number of total fares is the highest. In the pie chart we can see in July the number of fares in 14.5 percent. In this project we did below steps:

* Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural. As it is shown by the bubble chart, driver count is Urban cities is higher than suburban cities, which is higher that rural cities. We can say that in urban ciries the average of fares is lower and total number of rides is higher.
* Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following that can be found in PyBer challenge codes:
** The total number of rides for each city type.
** The average fares for each city type.
** The total number of drivers for each city type.
* Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
* The number of rides for each city type.
* The fares for each city type.
* The number of drivers for each city type. After doing all, we noticed that there is no outliers in our data.
* Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
* The percent of total fares. Total fares for urban cities is higher than suburban, and rural, which is %62.7.

* The percent of total rides. Total rides of urban cities is also higher, which is %68.4.

* The percent of total drivers. Total drivers is higher in urban cities, which is %86.7.

## Summary

The number of drivers in rural cities is 4-9 times less that suburban and urban cities, so the average for rides is higher in rural cities.
After doing the analysis, the last line chart that is showing data for all 3 different city types, indicating that the number of fares in Urban cities is higher than suburban cities that is higher than rural cities, because the number of drivers is higher in those city types.
