# PyBer_Analysis
Analysis using matplotlib

## Overview
This is an analysis for a ridesharing app company. In this project, we are creating visualizations for ridesharing data for the company using matplotlib, a python graphing library. In this project we are using different charts depending on what we would like to visualize such as line charts, pie charts, scatter, and bar charts. Each one of them is good to represent a dataset depending on the nature of data. For example, if we would like to compare different groups hights, it is better to use a bar chart as that will be more accurate and distinct.




## Results

We first visualized number of fares per month using different charts. We noticed that in July the number of total fares is the highest. In the pie chart we can see in July the number of fares in 14.5 percent. In this project we did below steps:

* Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
* Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
* The total number of rides for each city type.
* The average fares for each city type.
* The total number of drivers for each city type.
* Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
* The number of rides for each city type.
* The fares for each city type.
* The number of drivers for each city type.
* Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
* The percent of total fares.
* The percent of total rides.
* The percent of total drive
